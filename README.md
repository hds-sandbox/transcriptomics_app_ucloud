# Transcriptomics sandbox

In this app you will find material for the transcriptomics sandbox of the **[Health Data Science sandbox](https://hds-sandbox.github.io)**. This contains courses you can learn from, datasets and tools you can work with for your own research/learning purposes. Items of this sandbox might based on [Rstudio server](https://www.rstudio.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/):

- Rstudio server is a web-based integrated development environment for R programming language, including Rmarkdowns, code, and data. 
- JupyterLab is the latest Python web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

Usually, each item includes a dedicated webpage with additional informations, guides, and material.

## Available items

Items are periodically added to this app and can be chosen from the menu. Each item can be a course, a setup to work with specific softwares, a research example and comes with all necessary packages installed, eventual notebooks with computer code and explanations, and a dedicated webpage with additional material (notes, slides, recordings, ...).

### Courses

### Save your work

Everything saved in the `work` folder will be saved in your personal folder after you finish your job in UCloud.

## Additional options

Before submitting the app, you can choose a course and the amount of resources you need. Additionally, you can add folders so that they will be visible when using the app. Adding folders is useful if:

- you want to use a folder containing **your own data and code**, with which you want to perform analysis with the Transcriptomics tools of a course/module
- you want to continue working on the material **from a  previous session** of the Transcriptomics Sandbox. In such a case, add the folder containing the material using the option `Add folder`.
